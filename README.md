# Teach2Give JavaScript Challenge Series
A collection of friendly coding challenges to sink your teeth into the ins and outs of JavaScript

## Instructions
1. Create a repository called teach2give-js_challenge_series.
1. The folder structure in your repository should match the folder structure here, for example, you should have a folder 0x00-Introduction_to_JavaScript for the solution(s) to 0x00-Introduction_to_JavaScript folder in this repository.
1. For simplicity in review, write all solution in one file called ```solution.js``` but separate the solutions using comments each comment indicating the title for the question you are tackling. For example
```js
//1. Find the difference between two numbers
function difference(num1, num2) {
    return num1 - num2;
}

//2. Find the product of two numbers
function product(num1, num2) {
    return num1 * num2;
}
```

Good luck!
